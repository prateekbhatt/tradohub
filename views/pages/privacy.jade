    p Your privacy is critically important to us. At Tradohub we have a few fundamental principles:
    ul
      li We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
      li We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our product and service, or protect our rights.
      li We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our product and service.

    p 
      | Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
      br
      | If you have questions, please contact us at { info@tradohub.com }.
      br
      | At Tradohub.com ("Tradohub"), it is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

      strong Website Visitors
      br
      | Like most website operators, Tradohub collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Tradohub’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tradohub’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Tradohub may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

      | Tradohub also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Tradohub does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

    p 
      strong Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
      br
      | Certain visitors to Tradohub’s website choose to interact with Tradohub in ways that require Tradohub to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Tradohub gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Tradohub collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Tradohub. Tradohub does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

    p
      strong Aggregated Statistics
      br
      | Tradohub may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.

    p 
      strong Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
      br
      | Tradohub discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Tradohub’s behalf or to provide services available at Tradohub, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Tradohub, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Tradohub will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Tradohub discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Tradohub believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tradohub, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Tradohub and have supplied your email address, Tradohub may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Tradohub and our products. We primarily use our social media presence (facebook, twitter) to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Tradohub takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

      strong Cookies
      br
      | A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Tradohub uses cookies to help Tradohub identify and track visitors, their usage of Tradohub, and their website access preferences. Tradohub visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Tradohub, with the drawback that certain features of Tradohub may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

    p 
      strong Privacy Policy Changes
      br
      | Although most changes are likely to be minor, Tradohub may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Tradohub’s sole discretion. Tradohub encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
